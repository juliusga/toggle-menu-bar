# toggle-menu-bar
Apple script to toggle the menu bar visibility. Handy shortcut to prevent burn in when using with an OLED screen.

Majority of the script borrowed from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/78337425/13324181

Changes the value of "Automatically hide and show the menu bar" from "Always" to "In Full Screen Only" and vice versa. 

Tested on macOS Sonoma Version 14.5 (23F79)
